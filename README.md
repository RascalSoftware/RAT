RAT
===
RAT is an acronym for Reflectivity Algorithms Toolbox for Rascal This is a MATLAB toolbox for analysing non-polarized neutron reflectivity data at multiple contrasts. This is designed to fit multiple contrast neutron reflectivity data, primarily using the Abeles layer model but user-defined model function are also supported.

This is currently still in development. We are working towards a first release of the toolbox. In the meantime, please note that usage may change and that releases are not yet stable.

RAT
===
The Reflectivity Algorithms Toolbox (RAT) for Rascal is a MATLAB toolbox for analysing non-polarized neutron reflectivity data. The toolbox is designed to fit multiple contrast neutron reflectivity data, using the Abeles formalism with either traditional layer models, or using user-defined custom models.

How to Use
----------
MATLAB is required to RAT, the minimum supported version is **R2023a**. To use RAT, download and extract the appropriate version for you OS from the [release](https://github.com/RascalSoftware/RAT/releases) page. In the extracted folder, run the `addPaths` script in the MATLAB console and you can now run your analysis.

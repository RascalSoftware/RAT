Custom Models in Python or C++
..............................

Custom models are usually written in Matlab, but RAT allows alternative languages to be used. You can write your custom models either in Python or C++.
The reason for the Python functionality is mainly since this is the more natural choice when using RAT from Python with pythonRAT. The reason for C++ if for pure speed, where very 
computationally demanding custom models calculations are required.

Basic Plotting.

The simplest plot available is a simple display of the contents of the *problem* and *results* blocks.
This takes the following form:

.. code-block:: MATLAB

    figure(1); clf
    plotRefSLD(problem,results)

.. image:: images/misc/simPlot1.png
    :alt: disp(results)


This produces a basic plot of the reflectivity and SLD.

If this plot is not cleared before subsequent plots, then *potRefSLD* will overplot allowing the results of calculations to be compared:

.. image:: images/misc/runDE.png
    :alt: run DE

.. image:: images/misc/simPlot2.png
    :alt: fit plot

If you don't wish to overplot, just clear the figure before re-running plotRefSLD.

If you are resampling your SLD's, the *plotRefSLD* will automatically show the resampled layers for you:

.. image:: images/misc/resamPlot.png
    :alt: resampled plot

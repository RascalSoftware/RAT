This is ana anlysis of the ORSO 'round Robin" sample on ISIS instruments. 
There is data collected on Inter, PolRef and CRISP

- Makes a 1 layer model, applies it to the Inter data.
- Runs a Bauesian analysis of this
- Uses the Nested Sampler to screen between the 1 layer and 2 layer problem.
- Runs the 1 layer model on the other data, compares the results.
- Runs a full Bayesian analysis of the three datasets simultaneously.

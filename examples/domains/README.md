## 'Domains Target Functions' Examples

This folder contains examples of how to use RAT to analyse what are referred
to as 'Domains TF' samples, which are those where an incoherent sum is required
in order to calculate the reflectivity. As is the case for normal reflectivity i.e. non-polarised TF, 
it is possible to use either 'Standard Layers', 'Custom Layers' or 'Custom XY' models.

The basic principle for all three is that there is an additional fittable 
parameter group called 'domain ratio' (as compared to normal reflectivity). 
Then each actual measured contrast, along with the other usual parameters, 
has a 'domain ratio' field. 

The method for defining domains varies between standard layers and custom models, as described in these examples (and the Documentation).

% We need volumes for each.
% Use literature values:
vHead = 320;

% we use the volumes to calculate the SLD's
SLD_head = Head / vHead;
SLD_dHead = dHead / vHead;

% the volumes and the APM...
headThick = vHead / lipidAPM;
%tailThick = vTail / lipidAPM;

% In this example we manually apply the head hydration 
% by correcting the SLD based on coverage. Coverage is
% a parameter between 0 and 1, so we can just scale the
% SLD linearly depending on coverage value, using 
% the appropriate value for bulk_out for each contrast

D_headSLD = (Head_Hydration * bulkOut(contrast)) + ((1 - Head_Hydration) * SLD_dHead);

% Now we need to build up the layers. We use the 'contrast'
% input parameter to determine whether we need to use
% deuterated or hydrogenated versions of the two layers.
switch contrast

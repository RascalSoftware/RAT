## Bayes Validation

For low-dimensional problems, i.e. ones with a small number of parameters,
it is possible to directly calculate the Bayesian posterior on a sample grid.

In this worksheet (bayesBenchmark.mlx) we calculate a simple posterior,
then compare this against the posteriors returned from both DREAM and NS.

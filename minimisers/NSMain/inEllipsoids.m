function N = inEllipsoids(pnt, Bs, mus)

% function N = inEllipsoids(pnt, Bs, mus)
%
% This function works out how many of the ellipsoids (defined by the 
% bounding matrices Bs and centroids mus) contain the point pnt.  
% This number is returned in N.
%
% Bs is a [(Kxndims) x ndims] array, where K=total number of ellipsoids 
% and ndims = dimension of the parameter space.  
% mus is a [K x ndims] array.
% pnt is a ndims-dimensional vector.
%
% NOTE: in the future it may be quicker to input precalculated eigenvalues
% and eigenvectors into this function rather than the bounding matrices

function [output,sRough] = callCustomLayers(params,contrast,thisCustomFile,bulkIn,bulkOut,nContrasts)

% Call a custom layers function
% This function calls a custom model, which can be in Matlab, Python or
% Octave. The custom function is called 'custom layers', but the same
% routines are required for layers or XY, so the same function is used.
% For Matlab, the gererated C++ passes excecution back to the base Matlab
% workspace. For Octave, an embedded Octave interpreter is used. An
% embedded interpreter is also used for Python.


% TODO: Add the Octave and Python functionality.


% Split up the custom file array into name, language and path...
fName = thisCustomFile{1};
lang = thisCustomFile{2};
path = thisCustomFile{3};

% Call the relevant routines depending on the language required
%
% (1) Note that in order to generate code for use outside Matlab, it is
% necessary to comment out the 'callMatlabCustomLayers' option as this 
% will throw an error. To create the source code uncomment the dummy output
% for 'output' and 'sRough'. To create the mexy file, comment out the
% dummy returns and uncomment 'callMatlabCustomLayers which executes the
% Matlab custom codes in the base matlab workspace using 'feval.
% This option (i.e. using 'feval') will eventually
% be replaced by a dedicated C++ class which will instantiate and call
% an external Matlab session (or the base workspace) using the 'Matlab Engine 
% for C++' API...  
% https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/calling-matlab-engine-from-cpp-programs.html
%
% (2) It is not possible to build the full Library from Coder when using the Octave 
% interpreter, as there are name clashes between mex.h (Matlab) and 'oct.h'
% (Octave). To use Octave, comment out the Octave option, generate the code
% only using Matlab Coder, then manually include the Octave calling
% function, and the use external tools to build the dynamic library.
%
% (3) Embedding the Python interpreter has not yet been done
